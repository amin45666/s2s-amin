Can't. Whether you don't necessarily know about it or feel it or touch it, it is all around us in the ether. We are living, ladies, gentlemen, in the era of Romanticism.

Religion. So just as religion is declining, romanticism rises and is in many ways of replacement to secular alternative. So when we get together in love, you know, what's fascinating is the use of the beginning of the use of the word Angel to refer not to those winged creatures up in the sky, but to refer to other human beings. And there's a marked increase of this in the age of Romanticism. And nowadays, of course, many of us will cheerfully call our partner Angel. So we are, all of us, in a sense, in through the lens of romanticism, good people, our wings have been temporarily put aside, but essentially.	True

They're pretty perfect people, not particularly tainted by original sin. Now, I think this is highly troubling for relationships because it leads to that absolute problematic dynamic within any relationship, which is self righteousness. If you think that you're quite perfect and that your partner is quite perfect too, that's trouble anyway. And if you start a relationship, you'll soon start hitting upon things which will lead you to think that actually, maybe they're not that perfect. Now what do you do with that feeling if you're operating against an ideology that says that everyone in that your partner particularly, is by nature?	True

And deeply connected to the way that we learned about love as children, that is the foundation stone of psychotherapy. So you look at it and you look at how you are in adult relationships, and there are a million connections that you can make with how we learned about love as children. And the problem with this is that the way that we learned about love as children is likely to have been a bit problematic. It's likely that we received affection, certainly, but that, in one way or another, without necessarily meaning to our parents, did us a great disservice.	True
